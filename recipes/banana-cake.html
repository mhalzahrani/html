    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Remember that time I told you about the best banana cake I’ve ever had?</p>
    <br> 
    <p>I enjoyed obsessed over it at a family reunion the other weekend. My cousin made it and I stalked her down like a dessert creep and proceeded to talk her ear off about cream cheese frosting and spotty bananas for 35 minutes straight.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>11 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened</li>
        <li>3 ½ ounces marzipan</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>4 large eggs</li>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>2 medium bananas, cut into small chunks</li>
        <li>3 ½ ounces high-quality dark chocolate (at least 75%), chopped</li>
        <br>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9x13-inch pan.            </li>
            <li>Combine sugar, butter, marzipan, and vanilla extract in a large bowl; mix with an electric mixer until smooth. Add eggs one at a time, and mix until well combined. Mix in flour and baking powder.</li>
            <li>Stir in bananas and chocolate, folding them into batter. Pour batter into the prepared pan.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean, about 1 hour.            </li>
        </ol>
    </ul>
